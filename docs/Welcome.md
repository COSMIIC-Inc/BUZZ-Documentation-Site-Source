### Who We Are



### What We Do

We are establishing and sustaining an open source, modular network of active implantable devices for use in fundamental neuroscience, animal, and early feasibility human research.  Our open source concept includes all aspects of the implantable system that are necessary for pre-clinical and human use:  hardware, software, mechanical components, test documents, regulatory documents, and instruction manuals.

The COSMIIC concept is based on an existing platform implantable system, the Networked Neuroprosthetic (NNP) System, which was invented and developed at Case Western Reserve University by the investigative team. The first incarnation of the NNP System has already been developed with success demonstrated by an early feasibility human study, providing a strong existence-proof of the basic concept. Our goal with establishing COSMIIC is to make this system available to the entire research community in an open source, collaborative environment.
