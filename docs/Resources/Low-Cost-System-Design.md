# Low-Cost System Design

The COSMIIC System reimagined for use in large animal models and optimized for cost.

## Design in process

The low-cost version of the COSMIIC System provides the valuable step between benchtop development and human use with the opportunity for validation of your new neuromodulation therapy in an animal model. The system is being redesigned to use reduced cost materials and sealing, allowing for temporary use of 3-6 months that will not break your budget.

Currently, possible low-cost sealant materials are being tested for their resistance to leaching of water or salinity. This longevity testing is being done in a high heat, high salinity water bath to simulate accelerated aging of these materials in the bodily environment.
