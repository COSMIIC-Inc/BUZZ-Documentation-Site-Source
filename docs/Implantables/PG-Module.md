# Pulse Generator Module

The thing that stimulates muscles

---

## Product Description

The	four-channel	pulse	generator	module (PG4)	is	a	remote	module	utilized	for	electrical	
stimulation	of	nerve	and	muscle	tissue.		The	PG4	can	deliver	stimulation	to	four	
independent	monopolar	electrodes,	using	the	metal	case	of	the	PG4	as	the	common	return	
electrode.		The	PG4	is	small	enough	to	be	located	in	the	extremities,	including	the	upper	arm	
and	forearm,	thus	minimizing	electrode	lead	length	and	simplifying	surgical	lead	routing.		
The	cathodic	stimulation	output	of	the	PG4	matches	the	cathodic	stimulation	output	of	the	
existing	implantable	neuroprosthetic	devices	that	have	been	utilized	in	humans	since	the	
1970â€™s	at	the	Cleveland	FES	Center,	under	the	following	IDE	numbers:		G890084,	G900108,	
G950116,	G040214	and	under	PMA	P950035.	
The	PG4	is	connected	to	the	NNP	network	through	a	single	network	cable.		The	PG4	gains	
power	from	the	network,	receives	data	from	the	network	that	is	utilized	to	determine	the	
stimulation	parameters	that	should	be	delivered,	and	places	data	on	the	network	regarding	
its	status.	The	PG4	has	four	total	network	connections,	allowing	a	single	PG4	to	branch	from	
a	single	network	input	to	three	network	outputs.
The	PG4	has	internal	processing	based	on	the	AVR-core	processor	(Atmel	AT90CAN128).		
Computational	processing	is	used	to	identify	relevant	network	data	(typically	control	signal	
levels	from	the	sensor	module)	and	convert	that	data	into	the	appropriate	stimulus	levels	to	
each	electrode	based	on	pre-programmed	patterns.		These	patterns	are	customized	to	
provide	the	desired	coordinated	functional	responses	from	each	muscle	and	nerve.
The	PG4	combines	three	levels	of	failsafe	mechanisms	to	assure	that	potentially	damaging	
stimulation	is	not	delivered:		1)	hardware	limits	on	total	charge	per	pulse,	2)	software	limits	
on	stimulation	parameters,	and	3)	failsafe	magnetic	switches	in	both	the	PG4	and	the	power	
module.
