# Cables

The things that carry signals to and from modules

---

## Product Description

The Network Cable (NC) is utilized to conduct power and communication between 
implanted modules in the NNP System.  Power on the network cable is provided by 
connection to the power module.  Network communication can be generated on the 
network cable by any module.  The network cable is a critical component of the NNP 
because all remote modules depend on its proper functioning for power and 
communication.  Every remote module must be connected to the NNP network through a 
network cable.  

The network cable is a four-filar (7-strands DFT), two-conductor cable.  It is designed to 
combine features of low electrical resistance with strength and durability.  The network 
cable must conduct the power and communication signal without significant losses and 
must have excellent fatigue resistance for placement in the extremities where the cable may 
cross multiple joints.

The network cable is terminated at each end with an identical male connector for 
connection to any module in the NNP system. The network cable is designed to be easy to
connect and disconnect in surgery, yet maintain physical and electrical conduction at the 
connector within the body for the lifetime of the individual.  It is possible to replace each 
component of the NNP system, including individual modules or network cables, without 
disrupting the remaining implanted components.  

The total length of the cable varies depending on the location in the body, but is typically 
10-30cm.  Strain relief is provided at each end of the cable for durability and to provide 
stiffness for insertion into each module.
